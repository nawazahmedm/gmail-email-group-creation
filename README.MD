To create email groups using the Google API in a Spring Boot application, you'll need to integrate with the Google Workspace Admin SDK. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Set Up Google API Credentials 
    
    Create a Google Cloud Project:
        Go to the Google Cloud Console.
        Create a new project.
    
    Enable APIs:
        Go to APIs & Services > Library.
        Enable the Admin SDK API.

    Create Credentials:
        Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
        Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for web application or service accounts depending on your needs.
    
    Download Credentials:
        Download the JSON file with your credentials. This file contains your client_id, client_secret, and other necessary information.

Steps to Obtain credentials.json:

    Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://cloud.google.com/): Open the Google Cloud Console by click on Console link

    Click on **Select a Project** dropdown. Create or Select a Project: Select an existing project or create a new one.

    Enable APIs: Go to the API & Services section and enable the APIs you need, such as the Admin SDK.

    Create a Service Account:
        Navigate to the IAM & Admin section.
        Select Service Accounts.
        Click on Create Service Account.
        Provide a name and description for the service account.
        Assign roles, typically "Service Account User" and specific roles like "Directory Admin" for managing email groups.

    Create a Key:
        After creating the service account, go to the "Keys" section.
        Click on Add Key and select Create New Key.
        Choose the JSON key type and click Create.
        A JSON file will be downloaded to your computer.

    Secure the credentials.json File:
        Store this file securely and do not share it publicly.
        Place the file in a location accessible by your Spring Boot application, such as src/main/resources/credentials.json.
